* Product blocks query current WooCommerce product images, names, prices, and links without duplicating product data in ContactPanda.
* When WooCommerce is unavailable, the product block is hidden from the palette while existing product blocks remain intact and display a clear notice.
* The people list displays email addresses as plain text with a separate mailto icon and suppresses Groundhogg's global email detector throughout ContactPanda.

= 0.9.1 =
* Rebuilt the newsletter template editor as a three-part visual composer with draggable content blocks, an email canvas, and a contextual settings sidebar.
* Rich-text blocks now use the WordPress WYSIWYG editor, while image blocks select files directly from the WordPress media library.
* Blocks can be inserted, reordered by drag and drop, duplicated, removed, aligned, and edited without leaving the visual email canvas.
* Added a dedicated Newsletter settings tab for sender details, company and legal data, logo, colors, typography, email width, and a fixed footer.
* The company footer is locked in the template editor and automatically includes configured legal links and the unsubscribe link.
* WooCommerce email colors, sender details, header image, and footer text can be copied into ContactPanda without creating a permanent WooCommerce dependency.
* Existing 0.9.0 templates remain readable and receive the extended block properties when next saved.
* Hidden shipping-address fields are disabled and never remain required; copied billing values are cleared when a customer switches to a genuinely separate shipping address.

= 0.9.0 =
* Groundhogg tags are now read page by page without the former fixed limit; regular tags are no longer hidden merely because their names match WordPress roles.
* The repeatable migration maps every readable tag and assignment, omits only genuine internal Groundhogg status tags, and records source/target counts plus migration warnings.
* Tag management now follows the WordPress taxonomy layout with an add/edit panel, searchable table, row actions, bulk deletion, assignment counts, and pagination.
* Added an independent ContactPanda newsletter-template data model using the `cp_newsletter_templates` table; it does not depend on the selected contact data source.
* Added newsletter template management with drafts, duplication, archiving, search, and pagination.
* Added a responsive block editor for headings, text, images, buttons, dividers, and spacing, including ordering and removal controls.
* Added subject, preview text, sender name, reply-to address, personalization placeholders, and an automatic unsubscribe placeholder.
* Added desktop/mobile preview with a real test-contact representation and test delivery through the configured WordPress mail system.
* WooCommerce address AJAX saving now re-reads and compares every persisted address field before showing a success message.
* The active My Account menu item now prioritizes the theme's primary/hover accent color instead of a potentially white palette variable.

= 0.8.6 =
* Korrektur: Rechnungs- und Lieferadressen werden zuverlässig über WooCommerce und dessen zugrunde liegende Benutzerfelder gespeichert; eine unveränderte, bereits bestätigte UID löst keine unnötige erneute VIES-Abfrage aus.
* Ein eigener Menüpunkt „Tags“ steht direkt vor „Einstellungen“ bereit und arbeitet mit der aktuell gewählten Datenquelle.
* Die Tag-Verwaltung bietet Suche, Neuanlage, Umbenennen, Zuordnungszahlen und geschütztes Löschen samt bestehender Zuordnungen.
* Die Adresse in den Personen-Stammdaten ist über ein Bearbeiten-Symbol zugänglich und öffnet die strukturierte WooCommerce-Rechnungsadresse, ohne Daten zu duplizieren.
* Beim Verknüpfen eines WordPress-Kontos wird je nach Datenquelle korrekt „ContactPanda-Person“ oder „Groundhogg-Kontakt“ angezeigt.
* Im Kundenkonto steht die optionale Firma vor dem Namen der Rechnungsadresse und die UID-Prüfung vor der abweichenden Lieferadresse.
* Fremde doppelte UID-Felder werden im ContactPanda-Adressbereich gezielt ausgeblendet.
* Der aktive Menüpunkt unter „Mein Konto“ übernimmt die allgemeine Akzentfarbe des aktiven Themes.
* Die bestehende cp_activities-Struktur bleibt die Grundlage für die als nächsten Ausbau geplanten Notizen und weiteren Aktivitäten.

= 0.8.5 =
* „Mein Profil“ und WooCommerce-Rechnungs-/Lieferadressen speichern per AJAX mit Rückmeldung im Formular.
* Die Rechnungsadresse enthält ein einziges ContactPanda-UID-Feld; angegebene UID-Nummern werden vor dem Speichern verpflichtend über EU VIES geprüft und positiv markiert.
* Die Personendetailansicht zeigt die Adresse in den Stammdaten, eine reine E-Mail-Anzeige mit separatem Mail-Symbol und den Double-Opt-in-Status.
* Die Tabs lauten und folgen nun: Bestellungen, Rechnungs- und Lieferadresse, Events (wenn verfügbar), Broadcasts und Aktivitäten.
* Tag-Zuweisung, Entfernung und Neuanlage besitzen für Groundhogg eine direkte, kompatible API-Rückfallebene.
* Telefonnummern verwenden auch im Registrierungsformular getrennte europäische Ländervorwahl und einheitliche österreichische Abstände.
* Doppelte UID-Felder anderer Erweiterungen und der entbehrliche Dashboard-Text „ÜBERSICHTS-BEREICH“ werden nur in den ContactPanda-Ansichten ausgeblendet.

= 0.8.4 =
* Das kompakte Newsletterformular enthält nun Anrede, Vorname, Nachname, E-Mail-Adresse, Datenschutzbestätigung und ausdrückliche Newsletter-Einwilligung.
* Beschriftungen, Einwilligungstext, Schaltfläche sowie Erfolgs- und Fehlermeldungen des Newsletterformulars können in den Einstellungen bearbeitet werden.
* Bereits wirksam angemeldete Adressen erhalten keine weitere Double-Opt-in-E-Mail; die erneute Anmeldung wird nachvollziehbar protokolliert.
* ContactPanda Plus kann das kompakte Formular über eine stabile Erweiterungsschnittstelle durch ein veröffentlichtes, wiederverwendbares Formular ersetzen.
* Der leere Tag-Bereich in der Personendetailansicht wurde korrigiert; Hinweis und Eingabefeld überlagern sich nicht mehr.
* Die WooCommerce-Seite „Mein Konto“ zeigt Gästen zunächst nur die Anmeldung und öffnet das vollständige ContactPanda-Registrierungsformular erst über „Jetzt registrieren“.
* Das Kundenmenü beginnt mit Dashboard und „Mein Profil“, gefolgt von Adressen, Zahlungsarten, zusätzlichen Erweiterungsbereichen und Abmelden.
* Das Dashboard zeigt Bestellanzahl, Bestellsumme, bis zu fünf letzte Bestellungen und – bei vorhandener Event-Tickets-Integration – die Zahl tatsächlich besuchter Veranstaltungen.
* „Mein Profil“ ergänzt vor- und nachgestellten Titel, Telefonnummer und eine optionale Firma; die WooCommerce-Passwortänderung bleibt erhalten.
* Unter „Allgemeines“ wird das aktive Theme angezeigt. Ein geschützter Button aktiviert die Übernahme kompatibler Typografie-, Farb-, Formular-, Button-, Rahmen- und Rundungsstile.
* Das Dashboard ist kompakter und enthält wieder einen erklärenden Text mit direkten Links zu Profil, Adressen, Zahlungsarten und Passwortverwaltung.
* „Mein Profil“ besitzt eine feste Überschrift und ordnet Vor-/Nachname, vor-/nachgestellte Titel, die europäische Telefonnummer sowie die persönliche Adresse in Zweierreihen an.
* Die Telefonnummer verwendet eine getrennte europäische Ländervorwahl, erkennt eingegebene internationale Vorwahlen und formatiert österreichische Mobil- und Ortsvorwahlen.
* Die Passwortänderung wurde aus dem Profil entfernt und als eigener Menüpunkt umgesetzt.
* Die Rechnungsadresse kann auf Wunsch aus der Profiladresse übernommen werden. Eine gesonderte Lieferadresse bleibt verborgen, bis sie ausdrücklich als abweichend markiert wird.

= 0.8.3 =
* Protected extension update checks no longer retain a negative “no update available” response, so a newly published release can be discovered on the next WordPress refresh.
* “Check again”, license refreshes, and completed plugin updates now clear both ContactPanda metadata and WordPress' combined plugin-update cache.
* Der Firmenbereich im Registrierungsformular erscheint zunächst als einfache Zeile „Firmendaten anlegen“ mit großem Plus-/Minus-Symbol und öffnet die Felder erst auf Klick.
* Die gesonderte Lieferadresse verwendet denselben Aufbau; ohne Öffnen des Bereichs gilt weiterhin die Rechnungsadresse.
* Die gewünschte Kundenrolle wird als Dropdown angezeigt und weiterhin erst nach Double-Opt-in und administrativer Freigabe zugewiesen.
* Administratoren können die vorbereiteten cp_-Tabellen nun ausdrücklich als ContactPanda-Testdatenbank anlegen und aktivieren.
* Im Testdatenbankmodus werden Personen, Firmen, Tags, Zustimmungen und Aktivitäten in ContactPanda gelesen und gespeichert; Groundhogg bleibt unverändert.
* Kontakte, Firmen, Firmenbeziehungen und Tags können zu Testzwecken aus Groundhogg übernommen werden. Wiederholte Importe aktualisieren zugeordnete Kontakte und Firmen, statt sie anhand ihrer Groundhogg-ID erneut anzulegen.
* Die Einstellungsseite zeigt Tabellenstände und ein Protokoll des letzten Imports.
* Eine zweifach bestätigte Rücksetzfunktion leert ausschließlich die ContactPanda-eigenen cp_-Tabellen. Danach kann die Groundhogg-Testmigration erneut ausgeführt werden.

= 0.8.2 =
* Die Einstellungen sind in die Tabs „Allgemeines“ und „Kunden-Registrierung“ gegliedert; weitere Bereiche können später ergänzt werden.
* Unter „Allgemeines“ wird Groundhogg als führende Datenquelle angezeigt, sofern es aktiv ist. Eine Deaktivierung führt niemals zu einem automatischen Wechsel der Datenquelle.
* Die künftige Standalone-Datenstruktur mit dem Präfix cp_ ist vorbereitet, bleibt jedoch bis zur Fertigstellung der Datenzugriffsschicht und des Migrationsassistenten gesperrt.
* ContactPanda legt in dieser Version keine Standalone-Kundentabellen automatisch an. Bestehende Tabellen werden vor einer späteren expliziten Einrichtung oder Aktualisierung geprüft.
* Erkannte Integrationen werden samt Status „aktiv“ beziehungsweise „installiert, inaktiv“ angezeigt; ihre Daten werden bei einer ContactPanda-Deinstallation ausdrücklich nicht verändert.
* Kundendaten bleiben bei einer Deinstallation standardmäßig erhalten. Die Löschung ausschließlich ContactPanda-eigener Daten muss vorab ausdrücklich aktiviert und bestätigt werden.
* Firmen- und Lieferadressbereiche verwenden Plus und Minus statt eines Dreiecks; die Lieferadresse bleibt geschlossen, bis eine abweichende Adresse gewählt wird.

= 0.8.1 =
* Customers can choose their own unique WordPress username during registration.
* Company details are optional and shown in a collapsed section; form section headings now use the active theme's h3 styling inside each panel.
* Administrators can select which non-privileged WordPress roles customers may request. A requested role is never assigned automatically and requires both email confirmation and administrator approval.
* Pending registrations show the requested role and safely prevent approval if the role is no longer allowed or the email address is unconfirmed.
* Every entered VAT ID is validated through EU VIES on the form and again securely on submission; successful verification is stored on the new account.
* The optional shipping address remains collapsed until the customer explicitly indicates that it differs from the billing address.
* Administrators can edit the submission message, double-opt-in subject and message, confirmation message, redirect page and redirect delay.
* Double-opt-in messages support the placeholders {first_name}, {site_name} and {confirmation_link}; a missing confirmation link is appended automatically.

= 0.8.0 =
* Added a dedicated Settings page for the configurable business-customer registration workflow.
* Added the public [contactpanda_registration] shortcode with account, contact, company, billing, shipping, VAT ID and consent fields.
* Added separate email confirmation, optional marketing double opt-in and administrator approval states.
* Added a protected pending-registration list with approve, reject and resend-confirmation actions.
* Approved registrations receive only the administrator-configured non-administrator WordPress role; visitors can never choose roles, B2B groups, discounts or tax privileges.
* Registration data is mapped to the WordPress account and the existing WooCommerce, German Market and B2B Market profile fields without changing historical orders or invoices.
* Added configurable privacy, terms, success-page and notification settings plus integration diagnostics.
* The selected ContactPanda registration page can optionally replace the public standard WordPress registration while preserving the administrative login.

= 0.7.2 =
* List controls use a light grey default appearance and a dark grey hover state; green and red status indicators keep their semantic colours.
* All table cells are vertically centred.
* Email confirmation and marketing status are grouped closely in one column.
* Tag suggestions are restricted to Groundhogg tags and a selected tag is saved immediately without an additional Add button.
* WordPress roles use a separate field and an independent suggestion list containing roles only.
* Permanent tag deletion was removed from the person detail view; removing a tag from an individual contact remains available.
* Tags now have their own unbranded contact section; Groundhogg's automatically mirrored WordPress-role and opt-in-status tags are hidden there so roles and user-managed tags remain visibly separate.

= 0.7.1 =
* Stift und Auge stehen bei Personen in einer eigenen Aktionsspalte direkt nach Vor- und Nachname; beide besitzen einen mittelgrauen Hintergrund und weiße Symbole.
* Eine zusätzliche mittelgraue Statusanzeige vor dem Marketable-Symbol zeigt den aktuellen Groundhogg-Bestätigungsstatus der E-Mail-Adresse als Häkchen oder Querstrich.
* Das PDF-Symbol der Bestellliste erscheint rahmenlos direkt neben dem Auge in derselben Aktionsspalte.
* Die Broadcast-Liste ist kompakter und wird mit höchstens 20 Einträgen pro Seite sowie Vor-/Zurück-Navigation angezeigt.
* Groundhogg-Tags lassen sich in einem gemeinsamen Suchfeld mit Vorschlägen finden, neu erstellen, zuweisen und direkt als Tag-Chip von der Person entfernen.
* Das dauerhafte Löschen eines Groundhogg-Tags bleibt als getrennte, ausdrücklich zu bestätigende Aktion erhalten.
* WordPress-Rollen werden für Administratoren ebenfalls als durchsuchbare Mehrfachauswahl mit direkt entfernbaren Rollen-Chips verwaltet; die bestehenden Schutzregeln bleiben aktiv.

= 0.7.0 =
* Pluginname, Hauptmenü, technischer Plugin-Ordner, Hauptdatei, Seitenschlüssel, Textdomain und interne Präfixe wurden vollständig auf ContactPanda umgestellt.
* ContactPanda wird im ersten Block des WordPress-Adminmenüs unmittelbar nach Avada angezeigt.
* Ist Avada nicht aktiv, erscheint ContactPanda ersatzweise am Ende des ersten Adminmenüblocks.
* In der Personenliste ersetzen ein Stift- und ein Auge-Symbol die bisherigen Textlinks „Bearbeiten“ und „Ansehen“; zugängliche Beschriftungen und Hinweise bleiben erhalten.

= 0.6.6 =
* Das Veranstaltungs-Pop-up besitzt nun zwei Spalten: links kompakte Termins-, Orts- und Ticketdaten, rechts Bild, Titel, Kurz- und Langinfo.
* Beginn und Ende werden getrennt angezeigt; Veranstaltungsadressen werden aus strukturierten Feldern aufgebaut, sodass kein HTML-Code mehr als Text erscheint.
* Verkaufte und verfügbare Tickets werden gemeinsam mit der prozentuellen Auslastung dargestellt; unbegrenzte Kontingente werden eindeutig bezeichnet.
* Augen-Symbole erscheinen ohne Button-Rahmen und stehen in der Veranstaltungsliste direkt nach dem Titel; ihre Spaltenüberschrift ist nur für Screenreader vorhanden.
* Bestelltabellen verwenden die Reihenfolge Bestellnummer, Datum, Rechnungsnummer, Aktionen, Status, Zahlart und Summe.
* Unter der Summenspalte wird die Gesamtsumme der angezeigten Bestellungen ausgegeben; unterschiedliche Währungen werden getrennt summiert.
* In der Personenliste stehen „Bearbeiten“ und „Anzeigen“ nun unmittelbar unter dem Nachnamen.

* Das Auge öffnet Bestellpositionen, Adressen, Status, Summen und Zahlungsart in einem WooCommerce-orientierten Pop-up.

* Veranstaltungszeilen besitzen eine Vorschau mit Datum, Ort, Kurzinfo, Bild sowie gebuchten und verfügbaren Tickets.
* WordPress-Rollen werden ausschließlich Administratoren angezeigt und können als Mehrfachzuordnung sicher bearbeitet werden.
* Administratoren können ein WordPress-Konto mit sicherem Zufallspasswort und optionaler Einladung anlegen oder ein bereits unter derselben E-Mail vorhandenes Konto kontrolliert verknüpfen.
* Rollen- und Kontoverknüpfungsänderungen werden am Groundhogg-Kontakt protokolliert; eine Marketingzustimmung wird niemals automatisch gesetzt.

= 0.6.0 =
* Die Zahl der besuchten Veranstaltungen kann in der Personenliste auf- und absteigend sortiert werden.
* Vorname und Nachname werden wieder in getrennten Spalten angezeigt; „Bearbeiten“ und „Anzeigen“ stehen gemeinsam darunter über beide Namensspalten.
* German-Market-Rechnungen werden in einem Pop-up mit zusätzlicher Ausweichmöglichkeit für ein neues Browserfenster geöffnet.
* Neue Personen können direkt aus der Übersicht als unbestätigte Groundhogg-Kontakte angelegt werden; vorhandene E-Mail-Adressen werden nicht überschrieben.
* Groundhogg-Tags können bei einer Person zugewiesen, entfernt sowie neu erstellt werden.
* Tags können nach ausdrücklicher Warnung dauerhaft gelöscht werden; Groundhogg-Status-Tags sind vor dem Löschen geschützt.

* „Marketable aktivieren“ kann für bis zu 100 ausgewählte Kontakte gemeinsam ausgeführt werden.
* Vor der Änderung müssen Herkunft, Datum und die ausdrückliche Zustimmung für jede ausgewählte Person bestätigt werden.

* Jede erfolgreiche Änderung wird mit Datum, Herkunft, Bearbeiter und optionaler Notiz am Groundhogg-Kontakt protokolliert.

= 0.4.9 =
* Die Spaltenüberschriften „Bestellungen“, „Bestellsumme“ und „Besuchte Veranstaltungen“ wurden zu „Best.“, „Summe“ und „Events“ verkürzt.
* Vor- und Nachname erscheinen gemeinsam und ohne Zeilenumbruch; die Aktionen „Bearbeiten“ und „Anzeigen“ stehen zusammen darunter.
* Der zusätzliche Filter „Event-Besucher“ zeigt ausschließlich Personen mit mindestens einer tatsächlich eingecheckten Veranstaltung.

= 0.4.8 =
* Optionale Integration von The Events Calendar und Event Tickets Plus ergänzt.
* Die Personenliste zeigt die Anzahl eindeutig besuchter Veranstaltungen anhand tatsächlich erfasster Check-ins.
* Mehrere Tickets derselben Person für dieselbe Veranstaltung werden nur einmal gezählt.
* Die Personendetailansicht erhält einen Tab „Veranstaltungen“ mit Termin, Buchungsstatus und Verknüpfung zur WooCommerce-Bestellung.
* Gebuchte und tatsächlich besuchte Veranstaltungen werden klar unterschieden.
* Fehlen die Veranstaltungs-Plugins, werden Spalte und Tab automatisch ausgeblendet.

* Mehrfach gefundene Bestellungen werden anhand ihrer Bestell-ID entdoppelt; Rückerstattungen werden von der Bestellsumme abgezogen.

* Vorname, Nachname, Firma und Bestellsumme sind auf- und absteigend sortierbar.

* „Anzeigen“ öffnet eine schreibgeschützte Firmenansicht.
